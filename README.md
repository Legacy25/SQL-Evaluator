# SQL Evaluator
A SQL evaluator done as part of a graduate database class

This project translates SQL to an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation and then applies relational algebra rewrites to find an optimum query evaluation strategy. Efficient joins and external sort algorithms enable it to work with huge datasets even on limited memory.

Basic indexing has been used to optmize runtime.
