# SQL Parser
A SQL parser done as part of a graduate database class

This project involves translating SQL to an abstract syntax tree (AST) and then apply relational algebra rewrites to find an optimum query evaluation strategy. Out of place sort operations enable it to work with huge datasets even on limited memory.

Basic indexing has been used to optmize runtime.
